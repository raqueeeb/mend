/**
 * A small linter for this repository's own conventions.
 *
 * Not a replacement for ESLint. It checks the handful of rules that matter
 * here and that a general linter would need configuring to enforce:
 *
 *   - every exported function and class carries a doc comment
 *   - nothing in src/ writes to the console
 *   - no line is unreasonably long
 *   - nothing is imported from outside the standard library
 *
 * The last is the one that justifies the file. The project's only hard
 * promise is that it has no dependencies, and a promise with nothing checking
 * it is one that gets broken by accident.
